# TicTacToe3D
This Python project implements a more challenging and engaging variation of the traditional tic-tac-toe game known as "3-D Triple-Decker Tic-Tac-Toe". In this game, two players take turns to play on a 3x3x3 grid, with each player aiming to align three of their symbols (X or O) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across any of the three layers. The game offers an added dimension of complexity and strategy compared to regular tic-tac-toe.

Features:
Allows two players to participate.
Players are randomly selected to start the game.
Each player inputs their move by specifying the row, column, and depth of the grid.
Visual representation of the game board using ASCII characters.
Tracks the score of each player throughout multiple games.
Ends the game when one player wins or when there is a tie.
Displays the winner's name at the end of each game and prompts players for a new game.

How to Play:
Run the Python program.
Enter the names of the two players.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input moves and play the game.
Enjoy the immersive experience of 3-D Triple-Decker Tic-Tac-Toe and aim for victory!
